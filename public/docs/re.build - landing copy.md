## **WHY FOUNDING CLIENTS?**

`[OFFER BLOCK - SWAP LATER]`

**Section Header:**

## **We're New. So We Have Something To Prove.**

**Body:** Most agencies ask for $2,000+ upfront and expect you to trust them. We haven't earned that yet.

So we're doing something different. Our first 5 clients pay nothing until the work is done and approved. We carry all the risk. You carry none.

Why? Because we'd rather prove ourselves with results than promises.

Once these spots fill, we move to standard pricing. But right now, you get zero-risk access to a team that's hungry to deliver.

## **THE PROBLEM (Bento Grid Cards)**

**Section Header:**

## **Sound Familiar?**

---

**Card 1: The Vanishing Act**

Paid the deposit. Got ghosted. Three weeks of silence. Your money's gone. Your site isn't.

---

**Card 2: The Hostage Situation**

They "own" your code. $200/month "maintenance" forever. Want to leave? Good luck getting your files.

---

**Card 3: The Template Lie**

Paid $5,000. Got a $49 template with your logo on it. Could've done that yourself.

---

**Card 4: The Surprise Invoice**

"That'll be extra." Your $3k project is now $8k. Nobody mentioned this upfront.

---

**Section Footer:** We've heard these stories too many times. That's why we built re.build differently.

---

## **HOW IT WORKS**

**Section Header:**

## **Zero Risk. Here's How.**

---

**Step 1: Apply** Quick form to see if we're a good fit. We're selective—5 spots means we need projects we can knock out of the park.

*Time: 2 minutes*

---

**Step 2: Strategy Call** 30-minute call. We learn your business, goals, and taste. You get a fixed quote and detailed scope. No surprises hiding in fine print.

*Time: 30 minutes*

---

**Step 3: We Build** Design, development, and deployment to a private staging server. You can watch progress. You pay nothing.

*Time: 2-4 weeks*

---

**Step 4: You Review** Click every button. Test every page. Share with your team. Request changes until it's right.

*Revisions: Unlimited during design*

---

**Step 5: You Decide**

Love it? → Pay the invoice. We transfer everything. Not convinced? → Walk away. No invoice. No hard feelings.

## **FAQ**

**Section Header:**

## **Questions (And The Real Answers)**

---

**Q: What does "founding client" actually mean?**

You're one of our first 5 clients. You get zero-risk terms (no deposit, pay on approval) in exchange for helping us build our portfolio and—hopefully—a testimonial if you're happy with the work.

---

**Q: Why only 5 spots?**

Because we're a small team and we refuse to spread thin. Five clients means each project gets our full attention. When spots fill, we close applications.

---

**Q: What happens after the 5 spots fill?**

We'll move to standard pricing with deposits (amount TBD). Founding clients get locked into these terms for any future projects.

---

**Q: What's stopping me from taking the design and not paying?**

Your site lives on our staging server until payment clears. You can see it, test it, share it—but it doesn't go live until the invoice is settled. Standard IP protection.

---

**Q: How do I know you won't disappear?**

We don't get paid until you approve. If we vanish, we did weeks of work for free. The financial pressure is on us to deliver, not you.

---

**Q: Do you use templates?**

No. We use modern frameworks (React, Next.js, Tailwind) for speed, but every design is custom. We're building a portfolio—why would we use templates?

---

**Q: Can I update the site myself after launch?**

Yes. We build on user-friendly CMS platforms. Edit text, swap images, add pages—no developer needed.

---

**Q: What's your typical timeline?**

Landing pages: 1-2 weeks. Business sites: 2-4 weeks. Custom builds: Scoped individually.

---

**Q: What if I need changes after the site goes live?**

Founding clients get 1 month of post-launch support included. After that, we offer hourly support or retainer packages.

---

## **ABOUT / FOUNDER NOTE**

**Section Header:**

## **Why I'm Doing This**

**Body:** I've spent years watching agencies take deposits and disappear. Watching "final" invoices triple. Watching business owners get talked down to because they didn't know the jargon.

The incentives are broken. Agencies get paid whether they deliver or not.

So I'm launching re.build with the opposite approach. I don't get paid until you're happy. If I build something you don't love, I fail. Not you.

Right now, I'm taking on 5 founding clients at zero risk to prove this works. Once I've earned the trust, I'll charge like everyone else.

But for now? You get a studio that's hungry, attentive, and has everything to prove.
