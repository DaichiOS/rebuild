### **Product Description**

**re.build** is a boutique web consultancy based in Sydney, founded by Eddie, a senior full-stack developer with a background in building start ups and consulting for start ups that want to build tech products. He has build successful products across different industries like [https://www.heydochealth.com.au/](https://www.heydochealth.com.au/) and https://index.fun/ and http://wombathome.com.au/

The consultancy offers a high-fidelity, custom web development service that differentiates itself through a **"Zero-Risk" Founding Client model**:

* **The Offer:** Eddie designs and develops the entire website (using modern tech stacks like Next.js, React, and Tailwind) *before* the client pays a cent.  
* **The Guarantee:** If the client loves the result, they pay the agreed fixed quote and take full ownership. If they don't, they walk away with no invoice and no hard feelings.  
* **The Scope:** Services range from high-converting landing pages ($1,500) and business sites ($3,500) to complex custom web applications.  
* **The Philosophy:** It positions itself as the "antidote" to traditional agencies, offering direct access to the developer, no lock-in contracts, and full intellectual property (IP) ownership from day one.

### **Target Audience**

The primary audience consists of **Small to Medium Business (SMB) owners in Australia** (specifically Sydney) with 1–50 employees.

* **Specific Sectors:**  
  * Health clinics and allied health professionals.  
  * Trades and home services.  
  * Professional services (accountants, lawyers, consultants).  
  * Local retail and hospitality.  
* **Psychographics (The "Burned" Owner):**  
  * **Skeptical & Wary:** They have likely been burned by agencies before—ghosted after paying deposits, or sold a $5,000 "custom" site that turned out to be a $49 template.  
  * **Non-Technical:** They feel vulnerable because they don't understand the jargon (hosting, DNS, maintenance) and feel agencies exploit this ignorance.  
  * **Time-Poor:** They view the website process as a "part-time job" they don't want. They dread "homework," endless meetings, and slow turnaround times.  
  * **Craving Security:** They prioritize trust and fixed outcomes over "cutting-edge" buzzwords. They want to know exactly what they are paying for and that they won't be trapped.

### **The Specific Problem**

The core problem re.build solves is the **asymmetric risk and lack of transparency** in the traditional agency model, which leaves business owners feeling trapped and exploited.

* **The "Hostage" Situation:** Agencies often retain control of the code or domain to force clients into expensive, indefinite monthly "maintenance" contracts.  
* **The "Template Lie":** Clients pay premium prices for what they believe is custom work, only to receive generic, low-quality templates that they could have set up themselves for a fraction of the cost.  
* **Financial & Time Risk:** In the standard model, the client carries all the risk by paying a 50% deposit upfront. If the agency "ghosts" them or delivers poor work, the client loses that money and weeks of time.  
* **Scope Creep:** Clients frequently face "surprise invoices" where the final cost balloons far beyond the initial quote due to undefined scope changes.
