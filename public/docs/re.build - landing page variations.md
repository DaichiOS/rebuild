# **re.build Landing Page Variations**

## **A/B Testing Three Psychological Approaches**

---

# **Quick Reference**

| Variation | Psychology | Best For | Risk Level |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **V1: FOMO & Urgency** | Loss aversion, scarcity | Paid ads, decisive buyers | Medium (can feel pushy) |
| **V2: Results & Proof** | Social proof, credibility | Organic traffic, researchers | Low (universally effective) |
| **V3: Ease & Quick Wins** | Cognitive ease, relief | Busy owners, retargeting | Low (approachable) |

**Current Copy Style:** Balanced—mixes risk-reversal with founder story. Good baseline.

---

# **VARIATION 1: FOMO & URGENCY**

## **Strategic Thinking**

**Core Psychology:** Loss aversion—people work harder to avoid losing something than to gain something equal.

**Hypothesis:** Emphasizing scarcity and time pressure will increase application rate by pushing visitors to act now rather than "bookmark for later."

**Key Changes from Current:**

* Harder deadlines and countdown language  
* Explicit "what you lose" if you wait  
* More aggressive spot-tracking  
* Before/after positioning (founding vs. standard terms)

**Best Tested On:** Paid traffic (Google/Meta ads), returning visitors

**Risk:** Can feel manipulative. May attract lower-quality leads who respond to pressure rather than fit.

⚠️ 2 Founding Spots Left — These Terms Won't Return

**Headline:**

# **When Spot \#5 Fills, This Offer Ends.**

**Subheadline:** We're building websites for 5 clients before they pay a cent. Three spots are gone. Two remain. When they fill, we switch to standard agency terms—50% deposits, revision limits, queue times. This is the only window for zero-risk access.

## **WHY FOUNDING CLIENTS? (V1)**

**Section Header:**

## **This Deal Expires. Here's What Changes.**

**Body:** Right now, you can get a custom website built completely free—and only pay if you love it.

That's the founding client offer. It exists because we're new and need to prove ourselves.

**But here's what happens when spot \#5 fills:**

|  | Now (Founding) | After (Standard) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Upfront cost** | $0 | 50% deposit |
| **Revisions** | Unlimited | 3 rounds |
| **Access** | Direct to founder | Project queue |
| **Timeline** | Priority (2-3 weeks) | Standard (4-6 weeks) |
| **Risk** | Zero—walk away free | Deposit at stake |

We're not saying this to pressure you. We're saying it because it's true. Once we have 5 portfolio pieces, we don't need to take this risk anymore.

## **THE PROBLEM (V1)**

**Section Header:**

## **Don't Make This Mistake Twice.**

**Card 1: The Vanishing Act** *(highlighted)* Paid the deposit. Got ghosted. Three weeks of silence. Your money's gone. Your site isn't.

**This was preventable.** With zero-deposit terms, ghosting costs *them*, not you.

---

**Card 2: The Hostage Situation** They "own" your code. $200/month forever. Tried to leave? They quoted $500 for your own files.

**This ends with us.** Full IP transfer on day one. No strings.

---

**Card 3: The Template Lie** Paid $5,000. Got a $49 theme with your logo. Could've done it yourself for 1/100th the price.

**We don't use templates.** Every build is custom. Our portfolio depends on it.

---

**Card 4: The Surprise Invoice** "That'll be extra." Your $3k project hit $8k. Nobody mentioned scope changes had costs.

**Fixed quotes only.** The number we give is the number you pay. Period.

---

**Section Footer:** You've been burned before. You know how it feels. The founding client offer exists specifically so you never have to risk that again.

**But only for 2 more projects.**

## **FAQ (V1)**

**Section Header:**

## **Before You Decide**

---

**Q: Is this actually going away?** Yes. We need 5 portfolio pieces to launch properly. Once we have them, there's no reason to take on this risk. Standard terms with deposits make more business sense.

---

**Q: What if I apply and don't get a spot?** We add you to a priority list for the next opening. But we can't guarantee founding terms—those are first 5 only.

---

**Q: Can I think about it and apply later?** You can. But we've received 14 applications for 2 spots. We review daily. The math isn't in favor of waiting.

---

**Q: What's stopping me from taking the design and ghosting you?** Your site lives on our staging server until payment clears. You can see it, test it, share it—but it won't go live until the invoice is paid.

---

**Q: How do I know you won't disappear?** We don't get paid until you approve. If we vanish, we did 2-4 weeks of work for free. The pressure is entirely on us.

---

## **FINAL CTA (V1)**

---

# **VARIATION 2: RESULTS & SOCIAL PROOF**

## **Strategic Thinking**

**Core Psychology:** Social proof—people trust evidence over promises, and they trust peer experiences over company claims.

**Hypothesis:** Leading with specific, measurable outcomes and concrete details builds credibility faster than emotional appeals. Numbers feel trustworthy.

**Key Changes from Current:**

* Metrics and data throughout  
* Case study / project details  
* Process transparency that demonstrates expertise  
* Third-party validation signals  
* "Show, don't tell" approach

**Best Tested On:** Organic search traffic, referrals, comparison shoppers

**Risk:** May feel less emotionally engaging. Need enough proof to back claims.

**Note:** Since you're still building portfolio, some "proof" will be process-focused and forward-looking. Update with real metrics as projects complete.

## **WHY FOUNDING CLIENTS? (V2)**

**Section Header:**

## **We're Building Proof. You Get The Benefit.**

**Body:** We're a new studio. We don't have 47 testimonials or a wall of logos. Yet.

So we're doing something that proves we mean business: our first 5 clients pay nothing until they approve the finished site.

**Why this works:**

| The Problem | Our Solution | The Proof |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Agencies take money and disappear | We build first, get paid after | $0 upfront commitment |
| "Custom" often means templates | We use React/Next.js frameworks | Code is reviewable on GitHub |
| Revisions cost extra | Unlimited revisions during design | Fixed quote \= fixed price |
| You don't own your code | Full IP transfer on payment | You get the repo, the Figma, everything |

**Our bet:** If we deliver excellent work for 5 clients, word spreads. If we don't, we've worked for free. The risk is ours.

## **THE PROBLEM (V2)**

**Section Header:**

## **What We Heard From 30+ Business Owners**

*Before launching, we talked to small business owners about their web development experiences. Here's what came up repeatedly:*

---

**Card 1: Communication Breakdown** **"They went dark for weeks."**

23 of 30 owners reported extended periods of no communication. Average silence: 2-3 weeks.

*Our approach: Weekly video updates \+ direct Slack/email access.*

---

**Card 2: Budget Surprises** **"The final invoice was double the quote."**

18 of 30 paid significantly more than quoted due to "scope changes" that weren't clearly defined upfront.

*Our approach: Detailed scope document before work begins. Fixed price means fixed price.*

---

**Card 3: Ownership Confusion** **"I found out I didn't actually own my site."**

12 of 30 discovered licensing restrictions or ongoing fees they didn't expect.

*Our approach: Full IP transfer. You own the code, design, content—everything.*

---

**Card 4: Timeline Drift** **"4 weeks became 4 months."**

21 of 30 experienced significant delays beyond quoted timelines.

*Our approach: Average delivery 2-3 weeks. We don't start projects we can't finish.*

---

**Section Footer:** These aren't hypotheticals. They're patterns. We built re.build to be the documented opposite of each one.

---

---

**Q: Can I see the code during development?** Yes. We can give you access to the GitHub repo if you want to follow along or have a technical person review.

---

**Q: What CMS do you use?** Depends on needs. For most business sites: Sanity or Contentful. For blogs: MDX or Notion as CMS. We'll recommend based on your comfort level.

## **ABOUT / FOUNDER NOTE (V2)**

**Section Header:**

## **About re.build**

**Body:** re.build is a web development studio based in Sydney, launched in 2026\.

**Our focus:** Custom-coded websites for small and medium businesses who've been burned by template shops and absent agencies.

**Our model:** Pay-on-approval for founding clients. We build first, you decide after.

**Our stack:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS. Modern frameworks that are fast to develop and easy to maintain.

**The person behind it:**

I'm Eddie. I've spent years working in tech—including building distributed systems at Campaign Monitor and developing web3 applications. I started re.build because I kept meeting business owners with horror stories about web development.

The pay-on-approval model exists because I'd rather prove the work than promise it.

# **VARIATION 3: EASE & QUICK WINS**

## **Strategic Thinking**

**Core Psychology:** Cognitive ease—people choose the path of least resistance. The simpler something feels, the more likely they are to do it.

**Hypothesis:** Emphasizing how low-effort, fast, and hands-off the process is will reduce mental barriers and increase applications from busy business owners.

**Key Changes from Current:**

* Minimal steps, minimal time commitments  
* "Done for you" language throughout  
* Quick timelines emphasized  
* Removing burden from client

**Best Tested On:** Time-strapped owners, retargeting campaigns, mobile visitors

**Risk:** May undersell quality/value. Balance ease with credibility.

*With us: Send what you have. Bullet points work. We figure out the rest.*

---

*With us: We make the design decisions. You just say "yes, love it" or "change this."*

## **ABOUT / FOUNDER NOTE (V3)**

**Section Header:**

## **Why I Made This So Simple**

**Body:** I've watched too many business owners become unpaid project managers for their own websites. Endless calls. Constant decisions. "Homework" that eats into their actual work.

The incentives are weird. Agencies bill hourly, so more meetings \= more money. Templates are easy, so custom work gets deprioritized.

I built re.build with a simple goal: you tell us what you need, we build it, you decide if it's worth paying for.

No calls unless you want them. No decisions until the end. No payment until you approve.

Running a business is hard enough. Getting a website shouldn't be.

# **TESTING STRATEGY**

## **Which Variation to Test First**

| If your traffic is... | Start with... | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Mostly paid ads | V1 (FOMO) | Urgency converts cold traffic |
| Mostly organic/referral | V2 (Results) | Researchers want proof |
| Mixed / unknown | V2 (Results) | Safest, most universal |
| High bounce rate | V3 (Ease) | Simplicity reduces friction |

## **How to Test**

**Option A: Sequential** Run each version for 2 weeks. Compare application rates.

**Option B: Split Traffic** Use Google Optimize or similar to show different versions to different visitors.

**Option C: By Source**

* V1 for paid traffic  
* V2 for organic  
* V3 for retargeting

## **Metrics to Track**

| Metric | What It Shows |
| ----- | ----- |
| Application rate | Overall conversion |
| Time on page | Engagement |
| Scroll depth | Content relevance |
| Form starts vs. completions | Friction points |
| Lead → client rate | Quality of leads |

---

## **Recommendation**

**Start with V2 (Results & Proof)** unless you have a specific reason not to.

It's the safest, most universally effective approach. It builds credibility, works for both warm and cold traffic, and doesn't risk feeling manipulative.

Add V1 (FOMO) elements to the hero and final CTA once you've validated the core message works.

Use V3 (Ease) for retargeting people who've visited but haven't applied—they already know what you do, they just need a simpler nudge.
