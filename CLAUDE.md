# re.build Project Context

## Brand Voice & Tone

<brand_voice>
- **Direct and honest** — No marketing fluff. Say what you mean.
- **Australian casual** — "G'day", conversational, approachable
- **Confident but not arrogant** — We know what we're doing, but we're not above anyone
- **Risk-reversal focused** — The core differentiator is "pay only if you're happy"
- **Anti-agency** — Position against the typical agency experience (deposits, ghosting, templates)
- **Personal** — It's Eddie, not "we" or "the team". Solo developer, human connection.
</brand_voice>

## Key Messaging Pillars

<messaging>
1. **Zero Risk** — No deposit, no upfront payment, pay only when satisfied
2. **Local & Personal** — Sydney-based, happy to meet for coffee, direct access
3. **Transparency** — Fixed quotes, no surprises, no jargon, no upselling
4. **Ownership** — You own everything (code, design, domain), no lock-in
5. **Quality** — Custom code (Next.js/React), not templates, fast load times
</messaging>

## Core Value Proposition

<value_prop>
**The Offer:**
1. Free 30-60 minute audit of their business needs and online presence
2. Personalised pitch with specific recommendations
3. Free build + free hosting (live site they can test)
4. Pay only if they want to keep it—otherwise walk away

**Positioning:** Technical partner, not a contractor. We help businesses grow, not just deliver a one-off asset.
</value_prop>

## Customer Pain Points (Real Examples)

<pain_points>
Based on real conversations (e.g., Steve from pswithsteve.com.au):

1. **Overpaid, unclear value** — Paid $7k for a website, not sure what that money actually bought
2. **Unreachable developers** — Hard to get help after the project is "done". Response times go from 24hrs to 2 weeks.
3. **Mystery fees** — Paying hosting fees with no idea what they're for or if they're reasonable
4. **Helpless to grow** — Want to add features (booking system, forms, chat) but don't know how or who to ask
5. **Nickel-and-dimed** — Every small change (phone number, new photo) costs extra
6. **Trapped** — Don't really "own" their site. Dependent on people who don't prioritise them.
7. **Confused** — Feel dumb in technical conversations. Don't know what they need or if they're being ripped off.

**Key insight:** The pain isn't just "bad websites"—it's feeling abandoned, confused, and dependent on people who don't care anymore.
</pain_points>

</services>

## Copy Guidelines

<copy_rules>
- Lead with the pay-on-approval hook in headlines
- Use "I" not "we" — it's a solo operation
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- Use specific numbers when possible (5 clients, 20-minute call, 2-3 weeks)
- Avoid buzzwords: "cutting-edge", "innovative", "best-in-class"
- Preferred phrases:
  - "Pay only if you're happy" (not "satisfaction guaranteed")
  - "Strategy call" (not "consultation" or "discovery call")
  - "Walk away" (not "money-back guarantee")
  - "No BS" / "Straight-up" (Australian directness)
</copy_rules>

  - Value trust and fixed outcomes over buzzwords
</audience>

## Current Page Structure

<structure>
1. Hero — Hook with pay-on-approval, CTA to book strategy call
2. The Problem — Two-panel comparison (usual vs how I work)
3. What I Build — Simple, no upselling, let the call uncover needs
4. Why This Model — Step-by-step process explanation
5. Why Me — Local, No BS, You Own It (3 blocks)
6. About — Eddie intro, photo, personal story
7. Final CTA — Book strategy call, email alternative
</structure>

## Implementation Notes

- Form submissions: Currently client-side only, needs backend/email integration
- Booking: Will integrate Cal.com or similar for strategy call scheduling
- Analytics: Plan to add Plausible (privacy-focused)
